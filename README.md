# Sheepbot26
Sheepbot26 is a discord bot I made because I was bored.

# Usage
Install the packages with ```pip install -r ./requirements.txt```
Then make a config.json file, there is an example below
Either run main.py or run```docker compose sheepbot26 && docker run sheepbot26```

# Config
This is an example config. Save it as config.json
```
// config.json

{
	"token": null,
	"Activity": null,

	"dogwater": [
		"{name} is dogwater"
	]
}
```
