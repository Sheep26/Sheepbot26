# Sheepbot26
Sheepbot26 is a discord bot I made because I was bored.

# Usage
Install the packages if you havn't already by installing requirements.txt.
Then get a config an example can found below and save it under config.json.
Then run main.py.

# Config
You need a config to run the bot.
An example config looks likes this
```
// config.json

{
	"token": [
		null
	],

	"dogwater": [
		"{name:} is dogwater"
	],

	"Activity": [
		null
	]
}
```
